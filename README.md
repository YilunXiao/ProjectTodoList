# Project Todo List

## Summary

A very simple Todo List application specifically for keeping track of personal projects. Main goal is simplicity, but include key components that I need, such as sectioning projects into smaller parts to keep track of progress.

## Why

Many todo list applications feel like a grocery list. Most seem to list items and then have them be checked off. 
Large projects take time and need sub-tasks that need to be checked off first to keep track of progress. This will hopefully help make projects less daunting.

## Components

 - Simple and clean UI
 - Normal todo list
 - Sub-components for each todo
 - Store list in local storage
